# Official API Documentation

## Introduction

We are proud to introducting `HypeProxy.io v2.1 API` that bring many improvements :tada:

Since the beginning of HypeProxy.io we have provided a pretty poor API, this new release of our platform will change that dramatically.

This `v1` API will continue to work through the address: [https://api.hypeproxy.io/v1/](https://api.hypeproxy.io/v1/)

## API Swagger

With our API we provide a fully-featured swagger that documents all endpoints and allows you to do your tests without setting up a client locally.
