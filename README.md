# Official API Documentation

## Introduction

We are proud to introducting `HypeProxy.io v2.1 API` that bring many improvements!

Since the beginning of HypeProxy.io we have provided a pretty poor API, this new release of our platform will change that dramatically.

This v1 will continue to work through the address: [https://api.hypeproxy.io/v1/](https://api.hypeproxy.io/v1/)

And the new version will run here: [https://api.hypeproxy.io/v2/](https://api.hypeproxy.io/v2/)

## API Swagger

With our API we provide an fully featured swagger that documents all endpoints and allows you to do your own testing without setting up a client locally.
